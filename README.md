# Hi There ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pauaea a professional data/business analyst 
Hi there! I'm a student-athlete with a passion for turning data into insights and strategies. While balancing athletics and academics, Iâ€™ve been self-learning and developing my skills in data science through platforms like TripleTen. My journey combines hands-on learning with the drive and discipline that comes from competitive sports.
Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Business Administration degree, which I see as a complement to my technical skillsâ€”giving me a well-rounded perspective on how data can fuel smart business decisions.
 Over the course of my learning, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects focused on:

Data Visualization

Data Analysis

Insight Generation

Business Idea Development

These projects have helped me explore real-world datasets, uncover patterns, and make data-driven recommendations.
Tools & Technologies:
 ðŸ›  Python | SQL | Google Sheets | Tableau
I'm excited to keep building, learning, and collaboratingâ€”especially on projects that connect data science with business impact. Feel free to check out the rest of my Github, my resume or linkedin!
